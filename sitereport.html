                    <h3>Hi, my name is Subin Bhusal. My uon id 22425892 and I am a student of NAMI college   located at Gokarneshow, Jorpati. <br><br>
                        In my journey of studying bsc(software engineering) learning HTML and CSS has brought a unique experience and a memorable one. It was hard to comprehend at the start but slowly, it became more interesting and less stressful. The front-end environment which we have been seeing in our technological devices was and is possible through HTML and CSS So, overall learning HTML and CSS has been a good experience. 
                        <br><br>
                        At first learning HTML and CSS had been quite stressful but due time, the lecturer made it easy by going through the basics and explaining them in a proper manner. Then after explaining to us the basics on how to do and what to do by explaining further, he made clear what to do and not to do.
                        Discussing about the technical design of the website.I created a drop-down menu in the home page linked with other four pages.On the second page, which is the site report, I.e. the same page  .I just wrote down the technical things. For the Third page, i.e the project page, I included four projects. On the other page which is a blog, I included six blogs to read but all the links have been cleared to make the website more flexible. Then in the contact page, I simply added a form and a means to contact me including my email address and social media
